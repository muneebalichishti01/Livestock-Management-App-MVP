# Summary

* **Problem:** Bloated abdomen and coughing in a cow suggest potential issues.  It could be bloat (frothy or free gas) or a respiratory infection, possibly pneumonia.

* **Diagnosis:**  A vet visit is crucial for definitive diagnosis.  They'll assess the severity of bloat and listen to lung sounds to rule out pneumonia.

* **Bloat Solutions:**  Treatment depends on the bloat type.  Free gas bloat might require a trocar to relieve pressure.  Frothy bloat needs anti-foaming agents.  Severe cases require emergency veterinary intervention.

* **Respiratory Infection Solutions:**  Pneumonia treatment usually involves antibiotics, bronchodilators, and supportive care (rest, fluids).

* **Prevention:**  Good quality feed, regular parasite control, and prompt veterinary care are vital for preventing these issues.  If the problem persists, seek veterinary advice immediately.
